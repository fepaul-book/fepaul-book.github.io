I am a commputer science student at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz and currently writing my master's thesis on the topic of *Fully Homomorphic Encryption* in cooperation with [Atruvia AG](https://atruvia.de/) and [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/). 

In my Master of Science in Computer Science, I focussed primarily on machine learning and data mining, where I attended in-depth internships and seminars.
In my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, my main focus was on IT security and blockchain in particular, which I also wrote my Bachelor's thesis on.
In addition to the Master of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics, I am also completing a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, probably in April 2024. My main focus there is on stochastics and computational algebra.
In addition to my normal computer science and mathematics studies, I have also completed a Master of Education in Mathematics and Computer Science. The Master of Education is a degree programme for teaching these subjects at secondary school. 
In the last semesters of my studies, I also took part in courses of an interdisciplinary study programme called [QPlus](https://www.studienprogrammqplus.uni-mainz.de/) on topics such as cybercrime, Monte Carlo simulations, housing shortage, wealth distribution and climate change.
Alongside my studies, I also realised larger private projects.

#   I work as a Post-Doc in the Data Mining group at Johannes Gutenberg-UniversitÃ¤t Mainz, under the guidance of #[Prof. Stefan Kramer](https://www.datamining.informatik.uni-mainz.de/stefan-kramer/). I am a Principal #Investigator for the TOP-ML project, which deals with understanding the trade-offs between properties of #machine learning algorithms beyond performance. Before that, I was a PhD. student in the Machine Learning #Group at University of Torino, my hometown. [Prof. Roberto Esposito](http://informatica.unito.it/do/#docenti.pl/Alias?roberto.esposito#tab-profilo) was my advisor for three years.

#My research interests are centered around deep neural networks - I mostly research algorithms to constrain and #understand them better. I have published papers about algorithmic fairness, interpretability and connections #between them. I care deeply about making sure that AI applications can be beneficial to everyone - or at least #not harm anybody.

#If you are an undergrad and are interested in working on deep learning, interpretability and fairness please #check out the [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/projects) page. 


#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://#reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and #put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements #by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` #and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://#fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones #below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
