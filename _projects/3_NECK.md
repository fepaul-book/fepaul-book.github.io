[NECK - Network Construction Kit](https://fepaul-book.github.io/NECK/) is an educational website that allows pupils to playfully explore the functioning of neural networks. 
The website is written in pure HTML, CSS and Javascript and does not use any external libraries. All processes (including backpropagation) were implemented independently.

The core functions of the website are
- Create your own neural networks (delete, create, link, move neurons and outputs)
- Locking weights during training (these remain unchanged)
- Activate/deactivate the bias
- Changing learning methods (random, backpropagation, own), activation functions (incl. own), error metrics, number of rounds, weights of individual neurons
- Saving and loading networks and training data
- Visualisation of the backpropagation procedure, the weight history and the outputs

The website is intended for use in the classroom and therefore contains extensive [documentation for users](https://fepaul-book.github.io/NECK/docs/user-handbook/book/index.html) and [developers](https://fepaul-book.github.io/NECK/docs/developer-handbook/book/index.html).
