In March 2022, I took over the programming day called [Codenight](https://fepaul-book.github.io/codenight-book/) at Nieder-Olm secondary school. I planned and organized a total of five different workshops for all age groups, covering topics from website programming and game programming to programming an AI that can solve Tic Tac Toe using the minimax algorithm. Feel free to visit the official [Codenight website](https://fepaul-book.github.io/codenight-book/) to take a closer look at the individual workshops.

For the younger pupils, the basics of programming were explored in a playful way using a visual programming language called Blockly.

Another workshop involved programming their first website using pure HTML and CSS code. Each pupil was allowed to choose an animal and created a website with videos, photos and Google Maps links based on a template.
The websites were then finally hosted by me on a large [zoo website](https://fepaul-book.github.io/tierpark-website/UnsereTierwelt.html) so that the students could actually access the website from home.

In the intermediate level, both a car race and ping pong were implemented using the block-based programming language Scratch. 


In the upper school, the programming language Python was used to solve Tic Tac Toe and 4 wins using the minimax algorithm.
