I am delighted to announce that I have successfully completed the interdisciplinary study program QPlus at Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz.

Through this program, I had the opportunity to learn about a wide range of subjects, including:

    Topics closely related to my computer science studies:

        - Bitcoin

        - Digital Fascism

        - Monte Carlo Simulations

        - AI: Opportunity or Risk

    As well as subjects beyond the scope of computer science:

        - Climate Change

        - Five-Day Power Outage

        - Happiness: The Science of a Happy Life
